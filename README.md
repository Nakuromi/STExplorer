# STEXPLORER : Explorer plugin for Sublime Text 2

STExplorer : SublimeTextExplorer

This plugin lets you explore all your computer files and directory.

This is my first plugin for ST2 and my first use of python language. It is a beta version, please report me all bug you'll seen on Github.

## How to install

### Package Control

The easiest and quickest way of installing is to use [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).
This method will allow you to keep the plugin up to date with the latest changes.

### Clone from GitHub

You can also just clone the repo to your packages directory if for some reason you do not wish to use package control:

    git clone git://github.com/mathieu-desu/STExplorer.git

## How to use it

### Windows
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+o"], "command": "st_explorer" }

### Mac OS X
    { "keys": ["super+shift+o"], "command": "st_explorer" }

### Linux
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+o"], "command": "st_explorer" }

Invoke the quick panel and search for "STExplorer" or just use the key bindings.
